1. If I tried to withdraw the money (USD or EUR) from exchange to my UK bank account (Barclays), how do they process this, because I only have a GBP account? Will the bank reject the money transfer?



2. I have been trying to verify my Coinbase account for more than a week, however what I get every time every day is 'ID was unreadable', I am giving up on Coinbase now. Plus, a lot of people are complaining about pending withdrawal form exchange. Do you guys have any suggestions on which exchange is better on selling and withdrawing fiat?



Cheers!"""

Instead of focusing on how we're all going to buy lambos can we go back to 2014 when we sent that bobsled team to the olympics?  r/cryptocurrency is awash with Wall St style folks and this place is getting to be much less about tipping and much more about being very unDogey-like.  

If Doge ends up becoming ReddCoin, or Rai, or one of the double digit currencies, this entire place will be torn apart.  Tipping WILL be dead.  If you want a preview go visit r/cryptocurrency or r/bitcoin.  Neither are fun, helpful, or a community.  They are more like members only golf courses where members try to impress each other by the size of their portfolios, pretend that the white papers of their chosen crypto prove that they are the smartest person in the world, etc.  

Doge is the opposite of this.  Doge started off as a joke.  Doge traders built a community and decided to make themselves helpful.    Make Doge help others again."""

Happy New Year's everyone! Here's to a great 2018!

#Create Your Own Excel Spreadsheet for Tracking Crypto
##Create an Excel Query to Import Live Crypto Data
1.	Create a New Excel Spreadsheet to Track your Crypto
2.	Go to the ‚ÄúData‚Äù Tab
3.	Select the ‚ÄúNew Query‚Äù option ‚Äì this will open a Drop-down menu
4.	Navigate to the ‚ÄúFrom Other Sources‚Äù selection which will open another Drop-down menu
5.	Select ‚ÄúFrom Web‚Äù
6.	Enter the API URL you would like to utilize ‚Äì 
**Note ‚Äì I use Coinmarketcap, so this will be an instructional of how to utilize CoinMarketCap‚Äôs API**
**Here is an example of CoinMarketCap‚Äôs API** 
https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/ripple/
Replace **ripple** with the currency you‚Äôre interested in ‚Äì if you go to CoinMarketCap‚Äôs website and look up any currency, look at the URL and replace the **ripple** with what CoinMarketCap calls their currency.

7.	Select OK
8.	Select **Record** - This will open a Table View of statistics about your selected CryptoCurrency.
9.	Select **Into Table**
10.	Select **Close &amp; Load** - This will create a new Excel Tab and paste this information into a Table
##Create Some Metrics
Now that you‚Äôve got the Statistics imported into Excel, it‚Äôs time to create some meaningful statistics. These statistics can be updated by simply navigating to the ‚ÄúData‚Äù tab and selecting ‚ÄúRefresh All‚Äù
###Current Holdings
This metric will provide you a USD Fiat value of what your crypto is worth.
1.	In other sheet within this same Spreadsheet, create a ‚ÄúMetrics‚Äù sheet where you can make a clean looking dashboard to view your statistics.
2.	**Manually** enter how much of a selected currency you own in one tab - **Note ‚Äì I‚Äôd rather do this manually than expose Excel to any account details**
3.	Select an adjacent cell to this count
4.	Enter ‚Äò=‚Äô and navigate to the tab that contains the imported CryptoCurrency statistics
5.	Select the figure next to the ‚Äúprice_USD‚Äô statistic ‚Äì this will give you an updatable statistic of *Price per Coin*
6.	Adjacent to this cell, type the ‚Äò=‚Äô sign, select the manually entered quantity of Crypto you own, type the ‚Äò*‚Äô sign, and select the price per coin figure you added in Step 5.
7.	This will multiple Quantity of Coin owned by Price per Coin, giving you a ‚ÄúTotal Holdings‚Äù statistic
###Gain/Loss
This metric will provide an illustration of your US Dollar investment versus the current value of your Crypto, resulting in a ‚ÄúPortfolio Performance‚Äù type metric. 
1.	In the Metrics sheet you‚Äôve created, manually enter the fiat value that you spent to purchase the CryptoCurrency you‚Äôre tracking in the spreadsheet.
2.	Using the **Current Holdings** metric created in the last step, subtract the **Current Holdings** from the **Fiat Investment** statistic.
3.	This will provide you a value of your current holdings after the initial investment is subtracted ‚Äì this can be positive or negative based on the health of your investment.
###Portfolio Gain Percentage
Similar to the ‚ÄúGain/Loss‚Äù Statistic above, we can measure the performance of the portfolio in a percentage based metric.
1.	In the Metrics sheet you‚Äôve created, manually enter the fiat value that you spent to purchase the CryptoCurrency you‚Äôre tracking in the spreadsheet. (**Disregard if completed in the ‚ÄúGain/Loss‚Äù Step)
2.	Using the **Current Holdings** metric created in the last step, divide the **Current Holdings** from the **Fiat Investment** statistic and subtract the value by 100%
3.	Note ‚Äì this will look like this in Excel *=(CurrentHolding/FiatInvestment)-100%*
4.	This will provide you a percentage value of the performance of the currency, comparing your initial investment with the current monetary value of the CryptoCurrency.

Please feel free to let me know if there are any questions ‚Äì I feel that it is really helpful to utilize Excel as a tracking tool, and wrong that individuals would try and infect others with viruses. Hopefully these instructions can assist individuals in creating their own sheets!

Listen here man, I'm freaking the hell out. I'm reading all of this shit about crypto to crypto taxes and I'm about to go crazy. Is there any software to help keep up with the constant fluctuation of different cryptos? I mean, the price of cryptos change sometimes every minute or second, how does one keep track of that every second to make sure you report the right amount of taxes? 

Look here, I know how to pay taxes on what I make in dollars (even though I don't agree with it but that's a whole different argument) but God damn, crypto to crypto prices change faster then my aunt Jenny for Sunday morning service!  I could go to jail for making a  mistake? I probably can't ask for help in my town , it's a small, southern town with like a thousand people. Most of us out here don't even know what credit cards are let alone crypto money God dammit so good luck finding an accountant for this.
